cd android

# Copy the example properties file
cp keys.properties.example keys.properties

# Edit keys.properties and add your API key
echo "MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE" > keys.properties
```

**For iOS:**
Edit `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` and add your API key.

**For Web:**
Edit `web/index.html` and add your API key.

### 5. Firebase Configuration

flutter build apk
```

#### iOS Setup (macOS only)
```bash
# Place GoogleService-Info.plist in ios/Runner/
cp path/to/GoogleService-Info.plist ios/Runner/

# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Build for iOS
flutter build ios
```

#### Web Setup
```bash
# Build for web
flutter build web

# Serve locally
flutter run -d chrome
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Development Mode

```bash
# Run on connected device/emulator
flutter run

# Run on specific device
flutter devices  # List available devices
flutter run -d device_id

# Run with hot reload (default in debug mode)
flutter run --hot-reload
```

### Production Builds

```bash
# Android APK
flutter build apk --release

# Android App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS (macOS only)
flutter build ios --release

# Web
flutter build web --release
```

  "dart.previewFlutterUiGuides": true,
  "dart.previewFlutterUiGuidesCustomTracking": true,
  "flutter.showWebRecorderButton": true
}
```

## üîç Verification

After setup, verify everything works:

```bash
# Check Flutter installation
flutter doctor -v

# Run tests
flutter test

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Check app performance
flutter run --profile
```

## üì± Testing on Devices

### Android
```bash
